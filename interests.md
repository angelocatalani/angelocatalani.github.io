I'm addicted to soccer, cycling, reading and meeting new people :).<br> I support Juventus since I was 4 years old. I am totally astounded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadej_Poga%C4%8Dar">Pogačar</a> performace at Tour de France 2020. I am truly amazed by the world world time trial title won by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Ganna">Filippo Ganna</a>. This week (10 October 2020) I am reading the great book: <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B013UWFM52">Deep Work</a>.
