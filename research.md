*Arxiv Preprint, Under Review*

**Abstract:** Recent advances in Neural Fields have enabled powerful, discretization-invariant methods for learning neural operators that approximate solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on general geometries. Building on these developments, we introduce enf2enf, an encoder--decoder methodology for predicting steady-state Partial Differential Equations with non-parameterized geometric variability, based on recently proposed Equivariant Neural Field architectures. In enf2enf, input geometries are encoded into latent point cloud embeddings that inherently preserve geometric grounding and capture local phenomena....... [shortened for brevity]

**Abstract:** This paper presents a methodology to learn surrogate models of steady state fluid dynamics simulations on meshed domains, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). The proposed models can be applied directly to unstructured domains for different flow conditions, handle non-parametric 3D geometric variations, and generalize to unseen shapes at test time...

### A Comparative Study of Learning Techniques for the Compressible Aerodynamics over a Transonic RAE2822 Airfoil (2023)
*Computers & Fluids*

![pgnet paper cover](/assets/img/pgnet_cover.png){: width="600px" }


**Abstract:** In this study, the modeling of the compressible pressure field on the RAE 2822 airfoil using deep learning (DL) is investigated. The objective is to generate, at low cost, the complete Mach envelope from a given aerodynamic database... [shortened for brevity]
